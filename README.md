# SNHU-CS-305

Artemis Financial is a financial institution looking to create additional security measures into their existing system. My favorite part about this assignment was exploring static testing and determining where potential vulnerabilities may lie in the code I am testing. I believe I was able to complete this testing and interpret the results effectively for this assignment. The dependency check tool was undoubtably the most useful tool we used for this assignment. It made looking at differrent vulnerabilities within the API's used in the program very simple and straightforward. Most of the vulnerabilites within this program involved the use of older libraries which needed to be updated to the latest version. In order to test vulnerabilites in the future, I would suggest running the dependency check monthly and hiring a penetration tester to check for new vulnerabiliteis the dependency check may not have picked up. I had to run debugs on the software after implementing my oown code to ensure it was functional. After refactoring the code, I ran a follow up vulnerability check to ensure there were no new vulnerabilities added. The primary resource I used, aside from those provided, was stack overflow. Seeing how other people solved errors I ran into helped guide my debugging process. I would want future employers to look at the use of my hash function to send encrypted communications in the system.
